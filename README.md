# OpenLLM: Chat with Various LLM Models

OpenLLM is a versatile project that allows users to interact with different language models (LLMs). It leverages the [Perplexity API](https://blog.perplexity.ai/blog/introducing-pplx-api) for access to well-known open-source models like the LLAMA models or Mistral 7B. Additionally, OpenAI's API is used to communicate with GPT models.

## Features

- **Intuitive Chat Interface**: Users can seamlessly chat with various LLMs.
- **Chat History**: Basic chat history is stored locally in JSON files.
- **Token Counter**: Keep track of tokens used during interactions.

## Future Enhancements

- **Robust Error Handling**: Improve error handling for a smoother experience.
- **Embeddings**: Explore embedding techniques for richer context.
- **Optimizations**: Minor improvements and optimizations.

## Technical Details

OpenLLM relies on two Python libraries:
- [nicegui](https://nicegui.io/): Used for the user interface.
- [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com/): Facilitates communication with LLMs.
